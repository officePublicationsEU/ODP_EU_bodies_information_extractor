# OEU bodies information extractor

This repo extracts information about: 
* The EU corporate bodies from the EU bodies XML file from the [EU vocabularies](https://op.europa.eu/en/web/eu-vocabularies/dataset/-/resource?uri=http://publications.europa.eu/resource/dataset/corporate-body)
* The EU corporate bodies classificaiton from the EU bodies classification XML file from the [EU vocabularies](https://op.europa.eu/en/web/eu-vocabularies/dataset/-/resource?uri=http://publications.europa.eu/resource/dataset/corporate-body-classification)

# Asumptions: 
The corporate bodies and corporate bodies classification XML files must be in the same directory as the jupyter notebooks. So download the latest versions of the files from the links above.
